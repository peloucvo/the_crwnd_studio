            <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

            <article>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>The vast majority of design projects run smoothly, without any problems. However, from time to time, something does come up, and it’s important that we both have an understanding of how best to deal with it. These terms and conditions are designed to ensure that we are both protected from any unexpected circumstances. It also lays out the basic groundwork for how the project will progress, and what is expected of us both. In the interests of saving a lot of headaches, this document contains the strict minimum of legal jargon required to still be legally enforceable.</p>
                <p>By accepting a quote, you are considered to have accepted these terms and conditions in full.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
            <h2>What do both parties agree to do?</h2>
            <p>You agree that:<br>You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company, or your organization. You agree to provide us with everything that we need to complete the project including text, images, and other information as and when we need it, and in the format that we ask for. You will review our work and provide feedback and approval on time. Deadlines work two ways, so you will also be bound by any dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.</p>
            <p>We agree that:<br>We have the experience and ability to perform the services you need from us and we will carry them out in a professional and timely manner. Along the way, we will endeavor to meet all the deadlines set but we cannot be responsible for a missed launch date or a deadline if you have been late in supplying materials or have not approved or signed off our work on-time at any stage. On top of this, we will also maintain the confidentiality of any information that you give us and we are happy to sign an NDA if needed.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>Project delivery dates</h2>
                <p>If there is a hard deadline for your project, you must communicate it clearly upfront before payment is made. It is always our intention to complete your project on time. Revisions and your response times play a major role in the amount of time it takes to complete your project. Therefore, the project completion date we give you is not a guarantee.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>This contract allows for a set number of revisions as stated in the estimate. If at any stage, you are not happy with the direction the work is taking, you will pay us in full for everything we have produced until that point and cancel this contract.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>Text content</h2>
                <p>We are not responsible for writing or editing any text copy unless specified in the original estimate. If you would like us to write new content or edit text for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>Photographs</h2>
                <p>You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high-resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, we can suggest stock libraries. If you would like us to search for photographs for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that. If you need any advice on these formats we are always happy to help.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>Changes and revisions</h2>
                <p>All changes and revisions will need written approval in some form. If changes are given via a phone call, they will need to be confirmed in writing in an email and given the ok.</p>
                <p>Experience shows that fixed-price contracts are not always beneficial to you, as they can limit you to your earliest ideas. We do not want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of time we estimate we will need to accomplish everything you have told us you want to achieve plus a few revisions. But we are happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that will not be a problem, as we will provide a separate estimate for that.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>Making the most of changes and revisions</h2>
                <p>You must be specific with your feedback. If you are requesting revisions, it is most effective to offer examples of colors, fonts, images, and sites you like. Excessive revisions, tweaks, and miscellaneous changes are subject to additional charges at our discretion.</p>
                <p>Errors in text or formatting that we have introduced into your content will be fixed for free. However, any other edits such as typo/grammatical errors/wording changes carried over from the original copy may be subject to additional charges.</p>
                <p>We are not responsible for revisions or updates to a project once the final agreed-upon deliverable has been sent. If additional design, coding, or edits associated with this project are needed, a new project agreement will be created.</p>
                <p>NOTE: Once you approve a design, it is considered final.</p>
                <p>Final means we are happy to make changes should you request them, but all changes will be quoted and billed separately.</p>
                <p>Be sure to proofread carefully before approving the final design.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>Project cancellations</h2>
                <p>Should something happen for any reason whatsoever that causes you to cancel this project once it has begun, you are completely free to do so. You will simply be billed for any work completed up to the point of cancellation, and we will send you any work completed up to that point.</p>
                <p>Should some life-altering event happen to cause me to cancel this project, we will hand over any work completed up to the point of cancellation and refund you for any payments made on incomplete work.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>Legal stuff</h2>
                <p>We cannot guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we cannot be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings, or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you have advised us of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason is unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>Copyrights</h2>
                <p>First, you guarantee that all elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves or that you’ve permission to use them.</p>
                <p>Then, when your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will own the visual elements that we create for this project. We will give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we are not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images, and data you provided unless someone else owns them.</li>
                    <li>We will own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and we will license that you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only unless we agree otherwise. This basically just means that you cannot take the design we made for you and sell it to Nike, but otherwise will not impact you.</li>
                    <li>We love to show off our work and share what we have learned with other people, so we reserve the right unless you specifically ask us not to, to display and link to your project as part of my portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles, books or anywhere we deem appropriate.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>Rights of refusal</h2>
                <p>We will not include in designs, text, images, or other data anything which we deem to be immoral, offensive, obscene, or illegal. All advertising material must conform to all standards laid down by all relevant advertising standards authorities. We also reserve the right to refuse to include submitted material without giving a reason.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>Payments</h2>
                <p>We are sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. Therefore, you agree to stick to the following payment schedule:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>50% deposit paid upfront. Work will only commence once this is received in full.</li>
                    <li>50% remainder is payable on completion and not more than 30 days after receipt of finished product and invoice.</li>
                    <li>If payment is late, the statutory interest of 8% plus the Bank of England base rate will be charged, starting from the 31st day after the invoice date.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>The small print</h2>
                <p>You can not transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.</p>
                <p>Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document.</p>
